Reveal Past Present and Future Prediction Game

using Major Arcana Tarot Deck (22 cards)

Each card will be assigned a point value depending if it’s considered a good card or a bad card. Player will pull three cards.  The sum points of those three cards will determine if player won or lost the game.
( more details below)

First Round: PAST
Player pulls/draws a card from deck, if the card player pulls is higher than some num- player grows in spiritual consciousness (points) and gets to pull another card.
Else - If the card player pulled is less than some number– player loses spiritual consciousness(points). Points are taken away.
After first round- maybe prompt prayer if Would you like to retreat, or keep going to reveal your present and future?

Second Round: Present
If the card is good you get more points/ or points stay the same
If the card is bad you lose points

Third Round: Future
Same Idea as above.
Or maybe have future card trump all other cards to where if it’s a good card- player automatically wins despite score accumulated till that point.
If its not a good card, then it will take the sum of all three cards, and based on score will let player know if won or lost.# Unit1Project
